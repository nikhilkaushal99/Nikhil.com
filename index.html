    <p>Dronacharya College Rait and this webside is maded  by nikhil Got it 👍 You want a short speech / essay on “Value of Time” that you can copy-paste.
Here’s a ready-to-use version:

Value of Time

Time is the most valuable resource in our life. Once it is gone, it never comes back. Money lost can be earned again, but time once wasted is lost forever. Successful people understand the importance of time and use it wisely. Every second is precious, so we should plan our activities and avoid laziness. By respecting time, we can achieve our goals, build good habits, and live a disciplined life. Therefore, we must always remember that “time is life,” and valuing it is the key to success.

Do you want me to make it short (3–4 lines for speech) or a longer essay (1–2 pages)?</p>
